# Path planning methods for planar quadrotor
This repository contains the semester wise implementation of several methods implemented for planar quadrotor control. These methods include MPC, iLQR, LQR to follow a nominal trajectory, and minimum snap trajctory planning in differtially flat space of the quadrotor. Each folder above is the complete implementation of the same. The results for the same are as below.
